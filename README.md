# Analysis of Crime Correlation

This repository contains a data analysis project investigating the correlation between crime rates and various factors such as environmental conditions, social indicators, and infrastructural elements. The goal is to uncover meaningful patterns that could inform policy-making and crime prevention strategies.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

We aim to answer:
- How do variables like CCTV density, street lighting, and population density relate to local crime rates?
- Are there identifiable patterns or clusters in geographic crime data?
- Which factors most strongly correlate with specific types of crime (e.g., theft, assault, vandalism)?

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Geopandas** (for geographic mapping, if used)
